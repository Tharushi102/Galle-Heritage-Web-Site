                    <p>Galle's history extends back to the 14th century; at that time, it was Tarshish's historic seaport, and King Solomon used it to bring in valuables including elephants, peacocks, and jewels. Galle harbor was utilized by Persians, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Malays, Indians, and Chinese for trade during the fourteenth century. Early in the year 1400 BC, the seaport of Galle was crucial in the exportation of spices, particularly cinnamon, from Sri Lanka. Galle's modern history, however, began in the 16th century. With the arrival of Lourenco de Almeida in 1505, Portuguese navigators fortified Galle in order to protect the northern landside of the peninsula. However, when the Dutch came in Galle in 1640, they overthrew them. Before the British arrived, the 18th century was when Galle reached the height of its development. Galle, which was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the "cultural category" in 1988 and is most known for its centuries-old fort, is now a beautiful city that draws a large number of both domestic and international visitors. South Asian cultures and European architectural styles come together beautifully in Galle. While on vacation in this fortified city of Galle, there are many things to see and do.</p>
