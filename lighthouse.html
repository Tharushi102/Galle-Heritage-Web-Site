                    <p>The Galle Lighthouse, also known as Pointe de Galle Light, is a prominent landmark located near the entrance of the Galle Dutch Fort in Galle, Sri Lanka. It is one of the oldest lighthouses in Sri Lanka and serves as a navigational aid for ships entering the Galle Harbor.</p>
                    <p>The Galle Lighthouse was initially built by the British in 1848 during their colonial rule in Sri Lanka. It was constructed to ensure the safe passage of ships through the treacherous waters surrounding the fort. The lighthouse stands at a height of about 26 meters (85 feet) and is situated on a rocky outcrop at the southeastern tip of the fort.</p>
                    <p>Originally, the lighthouse utilized a large oil lamp with a catadioptric lens system to project the light. Over the years, the lighthouse has undergone several upgrades and modifications. It was electrified in 1936, and the original oil lamp was replaced with an electric light. Currently, the lighthouse is automated and powered by solar energy.</p>
                    <p>The Galle Lighthouse offers panoramic views of the fort, the ocean, and the surrounding area. It has become a popular spot for visitors to enjoy the scenic beauty and capture photographs. The lighthouse serves as an iconic symbol of Galle and its maritime heritage.</p>
                    <p>It's worth noting that the Galle Lighthouse is distinct from the clock tower mentioned earlier. The clock tower is not within the Galle Dutch Fort but is located in the center of the city of Galle, away from the fort. The clock tower is a separate structure that stands as a historical and architectural landmark in its own right.</p>
